1. List all customer names, addresses, and phone numbers:
SELECT (cust_fname||' '||cust_lname) AS "Customer Name",
(cust_billing_add_1||' '||cust_billing_add_2||' '||cust_city||' '||cust_state||' '||cust_zip_code) AS "Addresses",
cust_phone AS "Phone Numbers" From Customer;


2. Pick an order and get all information about that order included in the order form.
You donâ€™t need to compute the totals and the delivery fee. This may be split into two queries,
one for the header and the other for the order lines.

Part 1
SELECT o.order_id As "Order Name", (e.emp_fname||' '||e.emp_lname) As "Sales Rep Name", c.cust_id As "Customer Account",
(c.cust_fname||' '||c.cust_lname) As "Customer Name",
(cust_billing_add_1||' '||cust_billing_add_2||' '||cust_city||' '||cust_state||' '||cust_zip_code) AS "Billing Address",
(o.order_delivery_add_1||' '||o.order_delivery_add_2||' '||o.order_delivery_city||' '||o.order_delivery_state||' '||o.order_delivery_zip_code) As "Delivery Address"
From Customer c, Orders o, Employee e Where order_id = 6 and c.cust_id = o.cust_id and o.emp_id = e.emp_id;

Part 2
SELECT f.furn_id As FurnitureID, f.furn_type as Description, f.furn_qty As Quantity, f.furn_price As UnitPrice,
f.furn_qty * f.furn_price as ExtendedPrice From orderdetails d, furniture f where d.furn_id = f.furn_id;

3.What is the phone number of the salesrep who took order in the query above?
SELECT o.order_id, (e.emp_fname||' '||e.emp_lname) as SalesRepName, emp_phone as SalesRepPhoneNo
FROM employee e, orders o WHERE e.emp_id = o.emp_id and o.order_id = 2;

4.Pick a driver and list all customers whose orders have been delivered by him/her.
SELECT (e.emp_fname||' '||e.emp_lname) as DriverName, (c.cust_fname||' '||c.cust_lname) As CustomerName, o.order_id as OrderId,
FROM Orders o, Driver d, customer c, shipment s, truck t, Employee e WHERE c.cust_id = o.cust_id and o.order_id = s.order_id
And s.truck_id = t.truck_id and t.emp_id = d.emp_id and d.emp_id = e.emp_id and d.emp_id = 62422288;

5.What is the total value (quantity time unit price) of all items in stock that have unit prices exceeding $25?
SELECT furn_id, furn_type, ((furn_price)*(furn_qty)) as "Total Value"
FROM Furniture Where furn_price > 25;
