# Description
#### Universal Furniture Outlet (UFO) sells quality furniture for home and office use.  Its sales representatives use the attached form to take orders.  Customer account numbers on the form are unique.  Customers have only one billing address.  This address is filled out when a new customer account is created or when there is a change of address of an existing customer.  The delivery address is the place where the furniture are to be delivered.  It is filled in the order form if the customer decides to use the delivery service of UFO.  All furniture in one order are delivered to the same address.  UFO offers free delivery service for orders with a total value exceeding $1,000.  For smaller orders it charges a nominal fee of $50.  The customer is not charged the delivery fee if he/she declines to use UFO’s delivery service for orders less than $1,000. UFO owns several trucks for delivering customer orders.  Trucks have a vehicle number, license plate number, license expiration date, and inspection expiration date.  Each truck is assigned to a driver, who is an employee of UFO.  Every evening the operations manager plans the next day’s delivery.  Orders are broken into delivery units called shipments so that each shipment may fit into one truck.  A large order that cannot fit into a single truck may be broken into multiple shipments, whereas a small order may be delivered as a single shipment.  Shipments are assigned to trucks that are available for next day’s delivery service.  A truck may carry more than one shipment.  All items included in a shipment are delivered by one truck. Each type of furniture, such as computer desk, executive chair, etc., is identified by an item code.  The price of each furniture type and the quantity in stock are also tracked. UFO employs several employees.  Each employee has a social security number, name, address, and phone.  A driver, a type of employee, has a driver’s licence number and license expiration date, in addition to other employee information.  Sales reps are also a  type of employee.  All employees are salaried.  Sales reps earn commissions in addition to salaries. UFO wants to create an information system to manage its operatons.  UFO’s management team has hired you as consultants for this project.
